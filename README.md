## [The State Of AI Tools And Coding: 2023 Edition](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/the-state-of-ai-tools-and-coding-2023-edition/)

We got sick and tired of the media and talking heads claiming that AI tools like ChatGPT are just going to replace programmers. What do they know? What data are they even basing this on?

That's the problem.

There really is no data out there on how programmers are actually using ChatGPT or AI tools. Are they using them? Are they worried about them? Are their employers telling them to use them or not hiring developers anymore?

We wanted to find out the answers to these questions. So we put out a survey and gathered responses from June 3, 2023 to June 22, 2023 to find out if and how programmers are actually using AI tools.

**3,240 people completed the survey which might just be the biggest survey of developers on the topic of AI to date.**

Due to popular demand from the ZTM community and the programming community at large, we've decided to open-source the data so that anyone can do their own data analysis.
